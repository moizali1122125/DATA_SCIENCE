1. Choose a problem to solve using machine learning techniques: This step involves selecting a problem that can be solved using machine learning techniques. You may choose a real-world problem or a simulated one. It is important to select a problem that is relevant and interesting to you. 
2. Collect and preprocess data relevant to your problem: This step involves collecting data that is relevant to your chosen problem and preprocessing it so that it can be used for machine learning. Preprocessing may involve cleaning, transforming, and normalizing data. 
3. Split your data into training and testing sets: This step involves splitting your data into two sets - one for training your model and another for testing its performance. 
4. Build predictive models using appropriate techniques such as regression, classification, clustering, or deep learning: This step involves building predictive models using appropriate techniques based on the nature of your problem. For example, if you are solving a regression problem, you may use linear regression or decision trees. 
5. Evaluate the performance of your models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or AUC-ROC curve: This step involves evaluating the performance of your models using appropriate metrics based on the nature of your problem. 
6. Report on your findings in a short structured report containing fragments of code and explanations for addressing a set of machine learning tasks on the dataset: This step involves reporting on your findings in a short structured report containing fragments of code and explanations for addressing a set of machine learning tasks on the dataset. 
7. Critically assess strengths and drawbacks of various predictive modelling techniques used in your project: This step involves critically assessing strengths and drawbacks of various predictive modelling techniques used in your project. 
8. Submit your report via Moodle in either PDF or Jupyter Notebook format: Finally, you need to submit your report via Moodle in either PDF or Jupyter Notebook format.
